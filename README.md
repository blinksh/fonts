# Blink Shell Fonts

With [Blink Shell](http://www.blink.sh) you can have your terminal, your way. We know how important it is for you to have your color scheme and font that you feel comfortable looking at all day.

Although [iOS now supports installing fonts at the OS level](https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/12/ios-13-how-to-use-custom-fonts-on-iphone-and-ipad/), the process is still cumbersome.

In this gallery you will find a wide range of fonts to use with Blink:
- [Nerd Fonts.](https://github.com/blinksh/patched-fonts.git) - With an extended character set useful in new CLI text editors.
- [Normal fonts.](https://github.com/blinksh/unpatched-fonts.git) - The same set of fonts without Nerd Font patches.

To install them, just paste the URL of the CSS font under Appearance -> Fonts -> New Font.

These fonts are based on the great work at the [Nerd-Fonts repository](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), so to their maintainers goes all the credit.

For themes, check also the [Themes Gallery.](https://github.com/blinksh/themes)

## Fonts

All the included fonts should work right out of the box with Blink. A few of the fonts in this gallery were only designed in a single weight. Terminals now render bold, italic and bold-italic weights, and consequently we recommend using a font that includes all the variants. Using a font family that misses a specific weight will render ok but may misalign some elements. For example, using a font that misses bold will have Blink rendering bold with its own hints, which may give wider characters than the regular weight. You can disable this behavior within Settings > Fonts, with the "Enable bold as bright" switch.

To help you select a complete font, we have referenced here all the supported weights:
r = regular; b = bold; i = italic; bi = bold-italic

## Contributing
This repository consists of the generate_fonts.py script and the JSON feeds that point to locations where to download the font families. At the moment, the feeds will read from the Nerd Fonts repository to package all the variants as CSS files by Blink. The output CSS fonts are subsequently stored into two collections: patched and unpatched. Because files are really heavy, these collections are submodules to handle them as their own repositories.

Our plan is to keep our main feeds tied to the Nerd Fonts collection, and we accept new feeds for other fonts or collections.

If you want to maintain your own font repository, send it to us and we will link it here as well.

#### How to help us keep fonts updated
- If you need a specific font updated immediately, you can run the script yourself for that unique font within your machine, and then submit the specific font CSS as a PR for everyone else to take advantage of it.
- **Help us create GH Actions to run these scripts**. We will keep all fonts updated manually, but help automating and even using other repositories changes to trigger GitHub Actions may be more convenient.

#### How to help by adding a new font
Before adding a new font to the repository, there are a few things to take into account:
- Make sure you are using a Mono variant. Monospaced fonts sometimes may include larger icons or Proportional variants. Although Blink can render them, you will experience issues in some contexts, so it is better to stick to the Mono variant.
- Include all the font weights if available.
- If a font comes with and witout ligatures, create a new font as the ligature variant and name it "with Ligatures".
- Beware of licenses.

To add a new font:
- If the font is already included within the Nerd Fonts aggregator, and we missed it, just add it to the corresponding patched-fonts.json or unpatched-fonts.json feeds.
- If the font is in a different GitHub repository, you can create a different feed for it and maintain it under a different repository. In that case, make sure to add the proper base_url within the main script.
